# NEWS READER
>This project uses React JS + Redux (Redux Toolkit’s createAsyncThunk and createSlice) to complete the comments feature of the New Reader App.

>Whenever the featured article changes, you will asynchronously fetch the comments for that article and add them to your store so they display under the article. Likewise, when a user submits a new comment, you will submit it to the server via an asynchronous request and display it in the article’s list of comments once it has been successfully created.

>This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
